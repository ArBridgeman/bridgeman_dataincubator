# Stock ticker app

This application was created as an exercise in the Data Incubator Program. It uses Flask to deploy a website:
https://bridgeman-dataincubator.herokuapp.com/

When given a stock ticker symbol, date, and other information, a plot will be created. This was my first attempt at creating a Flask application. The stock ticker opening, closing, and other value information is obtained through querying Quandl's API.
